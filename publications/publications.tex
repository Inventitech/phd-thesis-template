%% We use the 'etaremune' environment (the reverse of 'enumerate') to get a
%% numbered list of publications in reverse chronological order. If the list of
%% authors is long, it might be useful to emphasize your own name with \textbf.

%% If your publications are in your BibTex file, you can use bibentry to list them here. Include in your preamble:
%% \usepackage{bibentry}
%% \nobibliography*  % tells bibentry to reuse the available bibliography data
%% Then here list your publications as:
%% \item[\faFileTextO~~1.] \bibentry{<citekey>}.
\begin{etaremune}{\small
\item[\faFileTextO~~1.] \emph{Moritz Beller}: Toward an Empirical Theory of
